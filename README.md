# find-editors

Some journals request you pick the editors for your paper submission. Recently, a journal asked me to choose among 131 editors, and the only information provided on their webpage was the institution and country of each. This is crazy. Therefore, I made this script to search for specific keywords in the abstracts of papers published by the journal editors so you can more easily select the most appropriate editors.
